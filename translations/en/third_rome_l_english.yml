 orthodox_icon_events.1.t: "The Mother of Christ"
 orthodox_icon_events.1.d: "Mourning the loss of both his entire family and his countryside farm a man from the war-torn province of [eleusa_church_province.GetName] reportedly spent a day and a night praying before the Eleusa icon of the [eleusa_church_province.GetCapitalName] cathedral. As the city itself was under occupation his sorrow was shared by many of his [Root.GetAdjective] brethren. The very next day it was as if the icon had heard his prayers. The loyal people of [eleusa_church_province.GetName] rose as one and evicted the remaining enemy forces.\nThe continued fortunes of the province seem unclear but as war and devastation haunt the [Root.GetAdjective] countryside many of our citizens are turning to the church for consolation and moral support."

The local clergy is convinced that this was the result of the widespread religious fervor that our icon of St. Michael has inspired. They report that young men have been coming from all parts of the area to see the icon of the Archistrategos and that they leave with a strong will to go to war in the name of their faith."

 orthodox_icon_events.4.t: "Christ Pantocrator"
 orthodox_icon_events.4.d: "As the ruler of all, Christ Pantocrator watches from above, in many of the church-domes around the country. Our veneration and extensive attention to this most central icon in any iconostasis also seem to have been the source of contemplation for many. Reminded of their own role in creation and of the rightful place of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] many are more content with both their own lives and with the government that rules them."

 orthodox_icon_events.5.d: "Our veneration of St. Nicholas seems to have made quite an impression on one of the merchants in a recent embassy from [benevolent_if_distant_neighbor.GetName]. The merchant was so impressed by the icon of St. Nicholas in [nicholas_icon_was_here.GetCapitalName], by the story of the saint, and by our devotion to Nicholas' legacy, that he decided to bestow three gifts. One gift will go to the cathedral where he saw the icon, one to the artist who created it and one to the benefactor who paid for it."

 siberian_events.1.d: "The prominent [Root.GetInfluentialRussians] family has offered to fund the expansion into [siberian_frontier_province.GetName] and the surrounding area, committing to the construction of forts there for the benefit of the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName]. In exchange they would receive the rights to exploit the area themselves. If we sign a charter to give them this right we will likely have little control of their conduct in the area, and they would also secure the initial profits, but in return they would both organize and fund fortifications for us."
 siberian_events.1.a: "An Excellent Idea."
 siberian_events.1.b: "We must instead quell the power of the [Root.GetInfluentialRussians]s."
 siberian_events.2.t: "Payment of Yasak"
 siberian_events.2.d: "While it is a vast and untamed region, only traversable in many places due to its rivers, Siberia is not an empty land. It is inhabited by a number of local tribes and chieftaincies. Some of these are more than happy to sell us furs while others can be persuaded to pay a tax in the same commodity for our protection.\nEither $YEAR$ has been an unusually productive year for the natives or our tax collectors have been unusually efficient when collecting their tribute. Regardless the Yasak has brought a much greater yield than expected this year."
 siberian_events.2.a: "Excellent."
 siberian_events.3.t: "Promyshlenniki"
 siberian_events.3.d: "The abundance of fur-clad animals in Siberia is a veritable treasure trove, not only for our country, but also for many of our poor serfs and townspeople. It has become increasingly common for adventurous men to form fur-hunting or trading expeditions, travelling far beyond our most distant settlements. When they return they bring precious sable and squirrel furs, worth a fortune back in [russian_center_of_trade.GetName].\nAt times, however, it seems some of them are willing to go very far in their pursuit of wealth. The cut-throat conduct of our 'traders' has enraged the tribal population in [siberian_frontier_province.GetName] and is causing a risk to the local settlement there."
 siberian_events.3.a: "There's nothing we can do about this."
 siberian_events.3.b: "We must control our people."
 siberian_events.4.t: "Cossack Exploration"
 siberian_events.4.d: "Groups of Cossack explorers have penetrated deep along the rivers of Siberia. Such private expeditions can sometimes be as much of a hindrance as they are beneficial, as the free-minded Cossacks have few qualms about using force, coercion or duplicity to get their way among the local population and states they come across.\nThe expedition that returns today brings good news, they have brought us new charts, as well as valuable goods."

 siberian_events.5.d: "Entrepreneurs sometimes fund Cossack explorers to penetrate deep along the rivers of Siberia. These expeditions can sometimes be as much of a hindrance as they are beneficial, as the free-minded Cossacks have few qualms about using force, coercion or duplicity to get their way among the local population and states they come across.\nA recently returned expedition has enriched the participants themselves but left us in conflict with a local tribe as well as one of our neighboring countries."
 siberian_events.5.a: "An unfortunate but necessary side effect."
 siberian_events.5.b: "We will have to compensate the hurt parties."
 siberian_events.6.t: "Gifts from Siberia"
 siberian_events.6.d: "While Siberia is rich in fur-clad animals it is rumored that precious metals and other more exotic things can be found there as well.

 russian_principality_events.1.d: "Ever since the days of the Kievan Rus the Russian principalities have employed a method of succession based on lateral seniority. Often this means that our dynasty will be ruled by its most powerful scion but at times this has left other claimants wanting to bypass the Kievan order.\nEver since the passing of $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family has been divided between those that support [Root.Heir.GetName] and those that would rather see the dynamic prince of [appanage_province.GetName] as the future heir. The young prince has wasted little time convincing as many of his uncles and siblings as possible to support him and his faction has now delivered an ultimatum to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 russian_principality_events.1.a: "We stand with [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 russian_principality_events.1.b: "Designate the prince of [appanage_province.GetName] as our new heir."

 russian_principality_events.2.t: "Agricultural Intensification"
 russian_principality_events.2.d: "An unusually prolonged period of peace and stability has allowed the peasants in large Monastic and Boyar estates to begin to adopt more modern farming techniques. Slash-and-burn remains the norm across large parts of our realm but with the spread of crop rotation the population in parts of our realm is growing significantly."
 russian_principality_events.2.a: "Excellent."
 russian_principality_events.3.t: "Minor Lords"
 russian_principality_events.3.d: "With the Tatar Yoke an increasingly distant memory and the expansion of land directly administered by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is becoming increasingly clear that we need more minor landholders. Traditionally the landed aristocracy would be the primary candidates to be given this privilege, even for smaller patches of land, but greater internal stability means that we could likely promote men of other qualities to take care of these matters of economy and agriculture."
 russian_principality_events.3.a: "Let us continue to favor the Boyars."
 russian_principality_events.3.b: "Let us distribute the land among smaller landholders."
 russian_principality_events.4.t: "Land Acquisition"
 russian_principality_events.4.d: "The Central power of the [Root.GovernmentName] is growing steadily and with no tribute to send to the Khans of Central Asia, so is our disposable income. An unusually rich harvest has left us with a considerable surplus. We could use this to boost our coffers for a rainy day, but we might also invest it to acquire the lands of minor princes and Monastic Estates."
 russian_principality_events.4.a: "Land is true wealth."
 russian_principality_events.4.b: "We need gold for the royal treasury."
 russian_principality_events.4.c: "We must use this as leverage in state affairs."
 russian_principality_events.5.t: "Famine of $YEAR$"
 russian_principality_events.5.d: "A combination of disease and harsh weather has completely ruined the harvest in parts of the [Root.GetAdjective] Realm. In times like these many turn to the state or the Church for support, others leave their lands or seek protection from powerful Boyars, Monastic Estates or even join the Cossacks in the wild fields."

 russian_principality_events.6.d: "Through our acquisition of [province_to_rob.GetCapitalName] we have come to control a major regional center of production and trade. The local artisans and merchants are both rich and successful in their trade and the city will surely be a great addition to our splendid [Root.GovernmentName].\nIt is hard to know, however, how far we can trust the [province_to_rob.Culture.GetName]. We should consider forcibly relocating the wealthiest and most successful local families to [province_to_grow.GetCapitalName] where we can more efficiently monitor and tax them. Some would say the damage we do to the city of [province_to_rob.GetCapitalName] is greater than any benefit we might hope for in [province_to_grow.GetCapitalName] but the added control is surely worth it."

 russian_principality_events.7.d: "Traditionally peasants have had the right to move from one area to another under controlled forms on the day of St George. This ensures some degree of mobility while also safeguarding that year's crop.\nLately, however, many landlords complain that peasants are abusing this privilege to seek a better life. The landlords of [serfdom_province.GetName] have today sought an audience, imploring that we revoke this right for their peasants. Otherwise they claim they will not be able to render the military service the state requires."

 russian_principality_events.9.d: "With the acquisition of Tatar lands we have become the overlord of the peoples to whom we were subjected for such a long time. While this is a victory for the [Root.GetAdjective] people it is also an opportunity.\nAs we have been so painfully aware for centuries the Tatars are excellent horsemen and know the steppes better than any other. If we should allow the local leaders to keep ruling their people, but in our name, they may well be open to the idea of serving in our armies."
 russian_principality_events.9.a: "An excellent idea!"
 russian_principality_events.9.b: "We cannot allow the Muslims such rights within our borders."
 russian_principality_events.10.t: "The [kremlin_here.GetCapitalName] Kremlin"
 russian_principality_events.10.d: "As our [Root.GovernmentName] grows so does the importance of our capital in [kremlin_here.GetCapitalName]. Like many Russian cities the core of [kremlin_here.GetCapitalName] is its Kremlin which houses the elite, the administration and the military offices. Outside the walls lies an ever-growing commercial Posad district, and even further the general suburbs.\nThe entire arrangement depends on the size and strength of the Kremlin, however, and many are worried that ours is both inadequately small and old-fashioned. A state with ambitions such as ours should ensure that the Kremlin is constantly improved, expanded and well maintained."
 russian_principality_events.10.a: "This will require a lot of manpower."
 russian_principality_events.10.b: "This will require all groups in the city to contribute."
 russian_principality_events.10.c: "The Church Estates will pay for this."

 russian_tsardom_events.1.t: "Riots in [rioting_city_province.GetName]"
 russian_tsardom_events.1.d: "Discontent related to a new tax that coincided with a local food shortage has culminated in riots in [rioting_city_province.GetCapitalName]. The citizens of this once loyal city now claim that the government has been undercutting their rights and forcing their sons into serfdom. Fleeing serfs from the surrounding countryside are joining the riots and the situation is quickly growing harder for our local [Root.GetLowLevelOfficialForCountry] to control."
 russian_tsardom_events.1.a: "Send in the Troops."
 russian_tsardom_events.1.b: "Give in to some of their demands."
 russian_tsardom_events.2.t: "Court Politics"
 russian_tsardom_events.2.d: "To be able to rise to a position near the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] at the [Root.GetAdjective] court can be very hard unless you belong to one of few old families with a long tradition of service. Even if someone of considerable skill would make himself known, the old families expect to dominate the higher ranks at court.\nLately a specific young courtier has been making a name for himself by performing outstanding service to the [Root.GovernmentName] but there are no positions for him to rise to. The old families would actively oppose the creation of a new position for such a self-made man and would not take kindly to us opposing them."
 russian_tsardom_events.2.a: "I am the true [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 russian_tsardom_events.2.b: "We need their loyalty."
 russian_tsardom_events.3.t: "Settling the [steppe_province.GetName] Steppe"
 russian_tsardom_events.3.d: "As our [Root.GovernmentName] grows it has come to incorporate a multitude of peoples. Far gone are the days when all our subjects were Christian [Root.Culture.GetName] peasants. Our expansion into the steppes has made us the overlord of both violently free-minded Cossacks and Tatar communities. Of course much of the steppe is also quite empty.\nWhile our empire is great our resources are also not unlimited. Often we have to make a choice. Do we want to get our own subjects to settle the newly conquered areas? Do we want them to remain dominated by the Tatars? Or should we let the Cossacks, with their disrespect for our strict laws, colonize them?"
 russian_tsardom_events.3.a: "As long as they obey our rule the Tatars can stay."
 russian_tsardom_events.3.b: "Let us resettle [Root.GetAdjective] peasants here."
 russian_tsardom_events.3.c: "These lands belong to the free Cossacks."
 russian_tsardom_events.4.t: "The Gaps of the Abatis Line"
 russian_tsardom_events.4.d: "For centuries the Tatars have been raiding our settlements, leading to the construction of a defensive line along the Steppe border. The Abatis line is a system of fortresses and garrisons intended to stop any raid from getting very far beyond the Steppe. As soon as there is a gap in this system, however, there is a risk of Tatar raids penetrating our borders.\nA recent raid at [tatar_raided_province.GetName] has penetrated our defenses and left unprotected settlements devastated."
 russian_tsardom_events.4.a: "We must make the Tatars Pay!"
 russian_tsardom_events.5.t: "The Sobor of $YEAR$"
 russian_tsardom_events.5.d: "In times of need the rulers of [Root.GetName] have been able to call upon the people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to lend their support in important decisions about the continued future of our [Root.GovernmentName]. The participation in such an assembly, or Sobor, is the duty of any upstanding subject of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and can strengthen the national resolve in difficult times.\nPerhaps in this perilous age the time has come to convene a Sobor, so that we can move forward with the support of the people?"
 russian_tsardom_events.5.a: "An excellent idea."
 russian_tsardom_events.5.b: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is the true [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and requires no such support!"
 russian_tsardom_events.6.t: "Expansion of the Bureaucracy"
 russian_tsardom_events.6.d: "As our [Root.GovernmentName] expands so does the need for more people to administer it. In the past, we have relied on local provincial governors, but over time the need to increase the number of people in the central chancellery, the [Root.GetAdjective] prikazy, has been growing greater and greater.\nUnless we increase the cadres soon we will not be able to meet the demands for more experienced clerks later on as the bureaucracy keeps on growing."
 russian_tsardom_events.6.a: "Appoint more administrators."
 russian_tsardom_events.6.b: "We can make do with what we have."
 russian_tsardom_events.7.t: "Traitors?"
 russian_tsardom_events.7.d: "It has come to the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the head of the [Root.GetInfluentialRussians] family has been amassing power and influence in a way that could make him a threat to the [Root.GovernmentName]. It is not entirely clear if the house of [Root.GetInfluentialRussians] has any aspirations against the throne, but if we want to ensure the supremacy of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]s we should act before it is too late."
 russian_tsardom_events.7.a: "Divide their lands among more loyal people."
 russian_tsardom_events.7.b: "Surely we have nothing to fear from the nobility of the land."
 russian_tsardom_events.8.t: "Lack of People"
 russian_tsardom_events.8.d: "In order to handle the growing number of provinces under our rule we have had to give a somewhat free hand to our provincial governors in appointing local clerks. In [state_with_problems.GetAreaName] this has resulted in a reduction of tax-paying peasants and those doing military service.\nIt has been strongly suggested by the central government that we move to restrict those who can take up service in the administration so that we can ensure that our armies and coffers do not lack for men."
 russian_tsardom_events.8.a: "We need the administrators."
 russian_tsardom_events.8.b: "Let us restrict soldiers and peasants from serving in the administration."
 russian_tsardom_events.9.t: "Foreign Officers"
 russian_tsardom_events.9.d: "It has become increasingly common for officers from other European countries to seek employment in [Root.GetName]. In some ways this could be a useful way to keep up with the development of warfare in other places. However, the price they ask is not cheap, and our own officers may feel we are disregarding their right to good positions."
 russian_tsardom_events.9.a: "Hire them."
 russian_tsardom_events.9.b: "We have no need for foreign talent."
 russian_tsardom_events.10.t: "Christian Converts"
 russian_tsardom_events.10.d: "Sometimes the subjects of various heathen chiefs, kings or other petty rulers flee their homeland to seek refuge under our protection. These people will then often convert to Christianity and swear their allegiance to us, eager to start a new life under our benevolent rule. This is in itself a most welcome development, but our own landholders view the new-comers with some suspicion. A peasant's place is his land and his movement should be restricted as far as possible.\nConverts of this kind have lately been flooding the [converts_moved_here.GetAreaName] area, to the great irritation of their old overlords. A group of local heathen strongmen has lodged an official protest to our representatives in the area, demanding that we give up their countrymen."

As lifelong soldiers they have families and businesses at home that they attend in peacetime and long wars make it hard for them to maintain this life. A delegation of Streltsy soldiers arrived today in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] asking to be allowed to return to their homes or to be compensated with higher pay."

 streltsy_events.3.t: "The Daily Life of the Streltsy"
 streltsy_events.3.d: "While being a Strelets means devoting your life to serve the [Root.GovernmentName] it does not necessarily mean you have an occupation you can live on in times of peace. Many of our Streltsy have settled in or around [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and lead normal lives as shopkeepers, craftsmen or other less martial occupations on the side. While they do get a certain salary for being at our disposal this is by no means enough to support a family and the state has often tolerated and even encouraged the soldiers to have alternate means of income.\nSome fear, however, that our Streltsy are forgetting what it is to be a soldier, and that they lack interest in keeping their equipment up to date or in good shape."

 streltsy_events.4.t: "Inspecting the Streltsy"
 streltsy_events.4.d: "While the Streltsy are expected to maintain much of their equipment themselves they cannot be expected to keep up with the developments in firearm technology. As the years go by many of their weapons grow evermore outdated, and in some cases worn and inefficient. Regular inspections are supposed to allow us to keep up to date with the training and equipment of all our Streltsy but it is no secret these are quite costly."

 streltsy_events.4.b: "There is no reason to waste government funds yet."
 streltsy_events.5.t: "Well Staffed Garrisons"

Often his position will then be inherited by his son and so the state is assured well armed and motivated soldiers for long times to come. All over our country this type of employment has made men seek our service, and while not everyone can join in offensive warfare, many make a welcome addition to the garrisons of our border fortresses."
 streltsy_events.5.a: "Excellent."
 streltsy_events.6.t: "Expanding the Prikaz"
 streltsy_events.6.d: "In the Streltsy the state has acquired a reliable source of professional infantry. In order to administrate their permanent service the state needs to keep an efficient bureaucracy. If we expanded the Streletsy Prikaz we could more quickly and efficiently organize, train and provision larger numbers of Streltsy. Some would caution that there is a cost to emphasizing speed, however."

 patriarch_events.1.t: "The Saints of [local_saint_state_province.GetAreaName]"
 patriarch_events.1.d: "There is great uncertainty in the see of [local_saint_state_province.GetAreaName]. While we are united in faith the people of the state, including many of the local priests, are refusing to participate in the feasts and celebrations of saints that are customary within our borders. They claim that these are not canonical and that they will observe the religious customs of their own ancestors, including the veneration of a number of suspect saints from the area."
 patriarch_events.1.a: "We must enforce the [Root.GetAdjective] saints and feasts."
 patriarch_events.1.b: "There is little to be gained on insisting."
 patriarch_events.2.t: "Liturgical Influence"
 patriarch_events.2.d: "The bishop of [local_see_province.GetAreaName] has objected to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the aggrandizing way [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] conducted the consecration of a Cathedral in [local_see_province.GetCapitalName]. While he insists he is not ungrateful for the great donations we have given to the Church the Bishop is questioning the use of breaking the liturgical canon to further the interests of the [Root.GovernmentName]."

The Metropolitan has let it be known that he expects us to help fund the repairs and that a general redecoration would also be quite beneficial for the church.\nPious architecture has seen great development since this house of worship was first built and it could certainly benefit from us bringing in foreign experts..."
 patriarch_events.3.a: "Let us give it a worthy renovation!"
 patriarch_events.3.b: "We can repair the damages but no more."
 patriarch_events.4.t: "Heresy in [judaizers_province.GetAreaName]!"
 patriarch_events.4.d: "Our newly appointed Metropolitan of [judaizers_province.GetAreaName] has uncovered a horrifying local heresy. He claims that the sect is denouncing the Trinity, the divinity of Christ and the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The Metropolitan has asked us to help him in this time of need as he will require many more resources to root out this heresy which is widespread among high as well as low.\nThe case seems very clear. Except it seems the sect has some supporters even in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Can we really afford to lose the support of these men and women and are they really as heretic as the Metropolitan claims?"
 patriarch_events.4.a: "Heretics must burn!"
 patriarch_events.4.b: "Clearly he is mistaken."
 patriarch_events.5.t: "Monasteries flourish in [monastic_province.GetName]"
 patriarch_events.5.d: "The Bishop of [monastic_province.GetAreaName] reports that the local monastic communities are growing at an unprecedented speed. The Estates of a local monastery in [monastic_province.GetCapitalName] have in fact grown so big and are so well kept that they have become the envy of our local administrator. The governor has become entangled in a conflict with the Monks over where exactly the demarcation between their lands and those of the [Root.GovernmentName] goes.\nThe time has come for central authorities to step in and settle the dispute. Helping the monastery would undoubtedly secure their gratitude, but this could also be an opportunity to get hold of more land for the state..."
 patriarch_events.5.a: "Clearly our governor is right!"
 patriarch_events.5.b: "We must listen to these men of God."
